data.map(doc => <TR doc />)

# <TR />

Since <TR /> has the data doc and data doc_id it can create temporary rules and keep them associated with
the row via the doc. They will not effect other data docs until they are sent to the db, but 'test criteria'
can be used to show which other data docs are affected. Test rule will basically run criteria without writing
results to the database.

> NOTE: reconfirm that the action are only run on the data docs that meet the criteria and not querying by
  the criteria's properties.
